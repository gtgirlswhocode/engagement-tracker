# engagement-tracker
Shows engagement between social, networking, and general body meetings (GBMs) from 2020 onwards. Need to add visualization for volunteering engagement

- data.csv has all the attendance numbers, with columns "date", "num_attendees", "event_name", "incentive", and "category." Will probably add "budget" in there as well
- main.js has the javascript and D3 code. 
- d3-tip.js is for the tooltip functionality
